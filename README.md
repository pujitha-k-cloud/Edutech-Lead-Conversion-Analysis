## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, validating, and analyzing an Edutech sales leads dataset to identify factors affecting lead conversions.  
The dataset contained multiple data quality issues such as inconsistent formatting, missing values, incorrect data types, and anomalies in date and categorical fields.  
The goal was to produce a cleaned dataset and extract meaningful business insights for decision-making.

##  Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Removed junk characters and newlines** from column names and cells.  
2. **Converted data types** ‚Äî dates into datetime, numeric columns into floats.  
3. **Handled missing values** ‚Äî filled numeric NaNs with medians and categorical ones with ‚ÄúUnknown.‚Äù  
4. **Removed duplicates** using `Lead ID` as a unique identifier.  
5. **Standardized text fields** (title-cased, stripped whitespace).  
6. **Validated logical consistency** ‚Äî ensured conversion dates were after lead generation dates.  

Result: a **fully clean dataset (132 rows √ó 15 columns)** ready for analysis.
